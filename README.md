### Hi folks ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ˜„ I am Siddesh Iyer, a passionate software engineer currently pursuing my Master's from the University Of Texas at Dallas in Information Technology and Management with an emphasis on data science. 
- ðŸŒ± I love staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the industry and discovering new ways to apply ML to real-world problems. Iâ€™m proficient in a variety of programming languages and tools, including Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch and Scikit learn. I also have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, and objected oriented programming concepts.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Deep Learning or NLP projects and would also love to review and implement a research paper in the domain. Feel Free to reach out to me regarding the same at iyersiddesh10@gmail.com.
- âš½ðŸŽ§ When I'm not coding, you can usually find me kicking around a football or listening to my favorite podcasts like Lex Fridman Podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience and Blowback. 
- ðŸ“² Feel free to ask for help regarding REST services, Stats, Machine Learning.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am currently learning to play the ukulele.
